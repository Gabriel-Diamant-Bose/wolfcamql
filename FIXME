* CG_Text_Paint_Limit fixes like Text_Paint
* CG_Text_Paint_Limit xscale for q3font

***** viewpoint stuff is fucked, you need to look ahead to see if it's a viewpoint or viewent, likewise if the cam point is viewent it needs to look head to see if it's viewent of viewpoint
* how are angles treated before going to ent
* select cam points and /transition viewpoints  will change all selected to have viewpoints and move evenly from the first to the last
* add, edit, basiccly anything stops camera playing -- also need to stop camera playing  CG_TimeChange()
* changecamerapoint is messedup -- changes origin to spline

* fx is parentVelocity player or q3 gib starting velocity?
* fx sprites overdraw
* fx bubble trails without defining weapon trails

* devmap and low timescale "CL_GetSnapshot cl.snap.messageNum - snapshotNumber >= PACKET_BACKUP"

* fx don't draw sprites over 1st person view -- done but it should be done manually in fx script
* freezetag obituary and parse_demo for obituaries  also alive status
* freezetag thaw stats
* useoriginter and spamming nextSnap == NULL when seeking
* ft follow others when frozen
